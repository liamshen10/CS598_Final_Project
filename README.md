To use this service

We cannot add the data needed here mainly due to the privacy of the data, and credentiels  needed. The uploaded .ipynb file shows all the cells already ran

What you need to download from MIMICIII db:
- NOTEEVENTS.csv
- admissions.csv
- diagnoses_icd.csv


Run the script on NOTEEVENTS.csv to reduce it to a sample size of 10000, to handle the data, make sure the new datafile is named sample10000.csv

Run through the cells.
